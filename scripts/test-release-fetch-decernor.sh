# test-release-fetch-decernor.sh - Offline controls for the checker download gate
#
# Runs the real scripts/release-fetch-decernor.sh in a throwaway repository with
# a stub curl that serves a local archive, and proves (PDR-0008 §2.5; EPR-0002):
# - a matching digest installs and resolves (positive control: the harness can pass)
# - wrong bytes are refused at the digest comparison, before extraction, and the
#   archive's binary is never executed
# - a failed download, an unpinned platform, a duplicated platform line and a
#   malformed digest are each refused for their own reason
#
# Needs no network, gpg, or real checker.

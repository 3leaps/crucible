# Portable Durable Record Contract

## Maturity and scope

This is the **proposed experimental contract** `contract: durable-record/v0`.
It defines what a durable record store promises to writers and readers: how a
record is identified, how revisions are bound to exact bytes, how a body held
outside the record is referenced, what an append receipt means, and how a
store declares which durability and deletion guarantees it actually provides.

It does **not** define a storage engine, a file layout, a table schema, a query
language, a sync protocol or a retrieval API. An embedded database, a journal
of files, a Git repository and an object-storage bucket can each sit behind it
and declare their guarantees through a stratum profile.

Deferred from v0 and not advertised in its vocabulary: **redaction of journal
history** (successor-generation semantics and completion receipts), shared
stream-level metadata inherited by records, multi-writer ownership of one
stream across hosts, automatic merge of divergent revisions, a wire binding for
remote operations, and behavioral conformance vectors. A v0 journal is never
mutated after append.

## Design stance

- **Records, not only events.** The unit is a record with a stable identity
  and one or more exact revisions. An event or measurement is a record with
  exactly one revision. A note or a reusable procedure is a record with many.
  A stream declares which of these it holds.
- **One thin envelope, typed payloads.** The envelope governs identity,
  revision, provenance, classification and body binding. Meaning lives in the
  payload, named by a host-less `payload_contract` token. The store never
  interprets, validates or rewrites a payload.
- **Profiles narrow, never widen.** A domain profile (for example agent
  session state, pipeline stage results or telemetry) may require fields,
  close the set of payload contracts, or require scope attributes. A profile
  may not add envelope fields, relax a rule, or change a meaning.
- **Identity is not location.** A body is bound by digest and length. Where
  the bytes can be fetched is resolved outside the record under the caller's
  access rules. Retrieval hints never appear in a record or its digest.
- **A receipt means persisted.** An `appended` or `revised` receipt means the
  entry is durable to the stream's declared failure model. Best-effort
  delivery is a stream declaration, never an inherited default.
- **Silence is not failure.** A writer that did not observe a receipt holds an
  indeterminate outcome and reconciles by idempotency key. It never infers
  that the write failed.
- **Conflicts are detected, never merged.** A revision presents the revision
  it supersedes. A mismatch is a conflict outcome; nothing is written as the
  new head.
- **Deletion is scoped.** A profile declares which deletion operations a store
  supports, per surface: the live head, retained history, managed replicas,
  external bodies, or decryption capability. A profile never states that
  anything *was* deleted; completion belongs to a per-operation receipt.
  Copies outside management are outside every claim.
- **Closed vocabulary.** Unknown entry types, outcomes, capabilities and
  stream modes fail closed. There is no `x-` extension prefix in v0.

## Capability and versioning

A stratum profile MUST carry the capability string
`contract: durable-record/v0`. Consumers resolve it to a trusted, pinned
`contract.json`, verify `capability`, and load the entry schema
(`stratum-profile.schema.json`). Records and journal entries do not repeat the
token.

Additive changes within v0 are permitted when older consumers ignore the field
or fail closed safely. Changing the meaning of a field, weakening the receipt,
conflict or deletion-scope rules, adding or removing an entry type, and
renaming fields without an alias are breaking.

## Governed objects

### Record

Schema: `record.schema.json`.

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `v` | `0`. |
| `stream` | Stream identifier; scope of record ids, sequence numbers and idempotency keys. |
| `record_id` | Stable for the life of the record, unique per stream, opaque. |
| `revision` | Positive integer. `1` creates the record. Each revision is exactly one greater than the revision it supersedes. |
| `supersedes` | Required when `revision > 1`: `{revision, digest}` of the revision being replaced in the same stream and record. Forbidden when `revision` is `1`. |
| `payload_contract` | Host-less token naming the payload's contract. Carried, never validated by the store. |
| `payload` / `body` | Exactly one. `payload` is inline I-JSON. `body` is a body reference. |
| `provenance` | Who produced this revision: `actor_kind` (`human`, `agent`, `process`), `actor`, optional `supervisor`, `model`, `tool`. Model and tool describe the producer; they do not own the record. |
| `classification` | `retention` (retention-lifecycle classifier key) and `sensitivity` (sensitivity classifier key). Both required; `unknown` is valid and is a decision deferred, not a default. |
| `labels` | Optional free tags. Never interpreted by the store. |
| `links` | Optional soft references to other `record_id` values in the same stream, optionally pinned to a revision. Not a graph contract. |

**Revision digest.** SHA-256 over the RFC 8785 canonical bytes of the whole
record object as written, including `stream`, `record_id`, `revision` and
`supersedes`. Records carry no store-assigned fields and no retrieval hints,
so the digest is the record's semantic identity. Byte-level integrity of a
journal file or export is a property of that bundle, not of the record.

**Pin.** `{stream, record_id, revision, digest}`. Record ids are unique only
within a stream, so a pin always names the stream. A pin resolves to a record
whose recomputed digest equals `digest`, or to nothing. Never to different
bytes.

### Body reference

A body is bytes held outside the record.

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `digest` | Required, `sha256:` + 64 lowercase hex, over the exact bytes. |
| `length` | Required, byte count. |
| `media_type` | Required. |
| `artifact_id` | Optional `contract: data-artifact/v0` artifact token when the body is governed as an artifact. |
| `encryption` | Optional `{scheme, key_ref}`. `key_ref` is an opaque token naming the key-custody record, never key material. |

**Body first.** A store MUST NOT acknowledge a record whose body it cannot
verify by digest and length at write time, unless capability
`unverified_bodies` is enabled. Every receipt for a record with a body states
`body_status: verified` or `unverified`. `verified` proves only that the
store checked the bytes against digest and length at write time. It is not a
claim of continued recoverability, which rests on the body's retention and
custody or on bytes included in an export. An `unverified` receipt never
satisfies a requirement for verified bytes. Record and body are
not assumed to be published atomically.

### Journal entry

Schema: `journal-entry.schema.json`. One NDJSON line per entry. `seq` is
monotonic per stream and gap-free. `group` and `group_size` follow the atomic
group rule of `contract: durable-queue/v0`: a prefix ending at `seq` N is a
consistent cut iff, for the entry at N, `N - group + 1 == group_size`.

| Type | Appended when | Carries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stream_opened` | A stream is created; always `seq` 1 | `mode`, `failure_model` |
| `appended` | Revision 1 of a new record is accepted | `record`, `digest`, `idempotency_key`, `body_status` if the record has a body |
| `revised` | A later revision is accepted against the current head | `record`, `digest`, `idempotency_key`, `body_status` if the record has a body |
| `deduplicated` | A write repeats a live key with the same revision digest (audit only; the caller receives the original receipt) | `record_id`, `idempotency_key` |
| `conflicted` | A write repeats a live key with a different digest, or presents a stale `supersedes` (audit) | `record_id`, `reason`, `presented` pin, `current` pin when a head exists |
| `retired` | A record is withdrawn from current reads; history retained | `record_id`, `reason` |

Unlike the queue ledger, `appended` and `revised` carry the record: a complete
journal is the portable form of the stream. `deduplicated` and `conflicted`
change no state and may follow `retired`. A v0 journal is never rewritten.

### Stream modes

| Mode | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `single_revision` | Only `appended`. `revised` is a `mode_violation` outcome. Fits events, measurements, stage results. |
| `revisioned` | `appended` then any number of `revised`. Fits notes, procedures, session state. |

### Write request and keyed idempotency

Every write presents an `idempotency_key`, scoped to the stream. Keyed
deduplication is core: the key is live for the profile's declared
`idempotency_window_ms`, measured from the original accepted write and
independent of later revisions or retirement of the record. Precedence: a live
key is checked **before** any revision or retirement rule.

- A repeat with the same revision digest returns the **exact original accepted
  receipt**, byte for byte the same outcome, pin, `seq`, failure model and body
  status. The store journals a `deduplicated` audit entry; the caller never sees
  a different outcome for a replay.
- A repeat with a different digest returns `idempotency_conflict` and accepts
  nothing.
- After the window, a repeated key is a new write and is subject to the ordinary
  revision rules.

### Write receipt

Schema: `write-receipt.schema.json`. One receipt per write.

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `outcome` | Accepted: `appended`, `revised`. Rejected: `idempotency_conflict`, `revision_conflict`, `no_head`, `mode_violation`, `body_unverified`, `retired_record`. |
| `stream`, `idempotency_key` | Always. |
| `pin`, `seq` | For accepted outcomes: the record's pin and the journal `seq` of its entry. |
| `failure_model` | For accepted outcomes: the stream's model the entry was acknowledged under. |
| `body_status` | For accepted outcomes, exactly when the record has a body: `verified` or `unverified`, as journaled. |
| `current` | For `revision_conflict`: the current head pin. |

`no_head` answers a revision (`revision > 1`) for a record that has no accepted
head in the stream. `revision_conflict` always has a head to report.

Outcomes other than `appended` and `revised` write no new head.

### Indeterminate writes and reconciliation

A writer that sends a write and observes no receipt holds an **indeterminate**
outcome. It reconciles with a lookup by `{stream, idempotency_key, attempted_at}`,
where `attempted_at` is the writer's own clock reading taken before it sent the
write. The lookup returns exactly one of:

- `found` with the **exact original accepted receipt** for that stream and key;
- `not_found`, only when the store can state a **coverage interval**
  `[window_covers_from, window_covers_until]` on the store clock. Inside it, every
  accepted key is retained and no accepted write holds this key. The interval
  must contain `attempted_at`, and `window_covers_from` must be no later than the
  earliest instant the write could have been accepted. The store declares its
  bound on clock skew between writer and store in its profile, and shifts the
  interval by it before comparing. `not_found` means absence at an authoritative
  observation. It does **not** prove that a delayed or in-flight write cannot
  still be accepted later. The writer may retry only under the **same** live key,
  which keeps the retry safe;
- `unknown`, when the window has elapsed, the key may have been evicted, the
  attempt is older than the retained interval, or coverage cannot be shown.
  `unknown` is never evidence that the write was not accepted.

A store with `idempotency_window_ms: none` always answers `unknown` and states
so in its profile.

### Export closure

An exported journal is `full_content` only if the bytes of every body referenced
by an included record are themselves contained in the export, and verify against
their digest and length. A digest checked earlier against bytes held elsewhere
does not make an export self-contained. Otherwise the export is
`references_only`: portable metadata, not evidence that the bodies are
recoverable. An export always states which.

### Stratum profile

Schema: `stratum-profile.schema.json`. The discovery root. As in the durable
queue, `build` (immutable artifact facts) and `runtime` (effective facts for the
exercised configuration) are distinct, and `runtime.enabled_capabilities` MUST
be a subset of `build.compiled_capabilities`.

`runtime.failure_model` is a guarantee: the strongest failure an acknowledged
write survives (`survives_power_loss`, `survives_process_loss`, `none`).

`runtime.history_policy` is chosen at store creation and is independent of
writer topology. v0 admits `append_only` only; `managed_redaction` is reserved
for the deferred redaction mechanism and is schema-invalid in v0.

`runtime.idempotency_window_ms` is required: keyed deduplication is core.
`runtime.clock_skew_bound_ms` states the bound the store assumes between writer
and store clocks when it answers `not_found`. The
value `none` states that the stratum performs no keyed deduplication and
cannot reconcile indeterminate writes; the schema admits it only when
`conformance` is `benchmark_only`.

`runtime.deletion` declares, per surface, which deletion operation the store
**supports**. It is a standing capability statement, never an outcome:

| Surface | Operation scope |
| --- | --- |
| `live_head` | The current revision can be made to stop resolving. |
| `retained_history` | Earlier revisions' bytes can be removed from the store's history. |
| `managed_replicas` | Copies the store manages (mirrors, remotes it publishes to, backups it owns) can be cleaned. |
| `external_bodies` | Bytes held by body references can be removed. |
| `decryption` | Decryption capability for retained ciphertext can be retired by key retirement. |

Each surface is `supported`, `unsupported` or `not_applicable`. In v0,
`retained_history` is never `supported`. `decryption: supported` is a claim
about key custody only and requires `key_custody_assumptions` (for example
escrow, wrapped keys, every recipient). It is never a claim about byte removal
or about plaintext already extracted. Every profile states
`unmanaged_copies: outside_claim`. Completion of any deletion is evidenced by a
per-operation receipt bound to target and store generation, defined with the
redaction mechanism; v0 profiles make no completion claims.

`origin: harness` means a qualification harness produced the profile from
observed runs. `origin: declared` is an unverified claim and MUST NOT be
presented as conformance evidence. v0 has no deterministic conformance
level; `conformance` is `benchmark_only` or `none`.

Capabilities in v0: `revisioned`, `body_ref`, `unverified_bodies`,
`key_retirement`, `export_bundle`. Conflict detection on `supersedes` and keyed
deduplication are core and have no capability. `managed_redaction` is reserved
and not in the v0 vocabulary.

## Portable invariants

1. **Exact revisions.** A pin resolves to a record whose recomputed digest
   matches, or to nothing. Never to different bytes.
2. **Linear heads.** At most one accepted revision per
   `{stream, record_id, revision}`. A write whose `supersedes` does not match
   the current head is `revision_conflict` and is journaled as `conflicted`.
3. **Keyed retry.** Within the declared window, a repeated key with the same
   digest returns the exact original accepted receipt, and a different digest
   returns `idempotency_conflict`. This holds even after the record was later
   revised or retired. Outside the window, or under
   `idempotency_window_ms: none`, retry safety is not promised.
4. **Receipt honesty.** A receipt states the failure model it was acknowledged
   under and the body status. A missing receipt is indeterminate, never
   failure.
5. **Retirement is not deletion.** `retired` withdraws a record from current
   reads and retains history. Byte removal is deferred from v0.
6. **Selection is declared.** An export of part of a stream (by record, label
   or profile scope attribute) keeps original records, sequence numbers and
   digests, declares omitted predecessors as a verification boundary, and
   states its closure. It is never re-sequenced or re-hashed and presented as
   complete.

## Composition

- **`contract: data-artifact/v0`.** A journal is a `record_stream` grain;
  bodies may be artifacts.
- **`contract: segmented-snapshot/v0`.** Sealed exports of a journal are
  snapshots. Durable-record governs the live journal; segmented-snapshot governs
  the sealed bundle.
- **`contract: durable-queue/v0`.** Shares the atomic group and consistent cut
  idiom and the build/runtime profile split. Delivery, leases and fencing are
  not record semantics.
- **Classifiers.** `classification.retention` and `classification.sensitivity`
  use the retention-lifecycle and sensitivity classifier keys.
